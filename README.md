### Overview

Our goal is to make the degree planning process quicker, easier, and more comprehensible. With the current Degree Planner data is scattered across multiple different pages and the overall UX is poor. This can lead to insufficient planning, where the proper prerequisites are not completed. We hope to develop a single unified design containing all of a student's degree planning needs.

The database would automatically write in information from Cal Polyâ€™s course catalog. Users can then make requests to the API to retrieve information about specific courses (notably prerequisites) based on what courses they have completed / enrolled in.

We will also have analyis logic for suggesting a priority for courses based on a number of factors (number of prerequisites, if the course is required to graduate, etc.). This will help students choose which courses to prioritize, and allow them to build a full degree plan.
